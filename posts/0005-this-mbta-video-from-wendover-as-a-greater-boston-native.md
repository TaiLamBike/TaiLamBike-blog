# 5: This MBTA video from Wendover, as a Greater Boston native

Wendover Productions released a YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDXsVhFG7TE) in
December 2023 about the MBTA.

Really horrible clickbait title, though interesting content.  (You should probably stop engaging in
this trashy and honestly underhanded practice.  Who's the editor that pushed for or approved this
title?)<!--more-->

Having ring(-like) connections in the subway networks is an interesting idea.  However, I'm not show
how this could be done IRL.  Maybe this can be done on the buses, but I don't see this happening for
the T's light railway lines anytime soon.# 5: This MBTA video from Wendover, as a Greater Boston native
