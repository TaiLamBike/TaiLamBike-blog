# 7: The ABCs bike check

Do you know your ABCs of bike checks?

## Air
* Find pressure reading on air pump
    * Read the pressure on the tire, inflate to halfway
        * Too close to the smallest number will not last very long
        * Too high can cause inner tube to break
* If no pressure reading, then inflate until 
    * Tires need a lot more air than you

## Brakes
* Rim brakes should engage easily
* Adjust so that there is a distance of 1 thumb to the handlebar when stopping

## Chains (also crank and cassette)
* Chain should move easily, avoid stuck links or rust
* Cranks should not move left/right
* Cassette (gearing on the back wheel would be free to move)

## Seat height
* Hip height
* Tip: to stop and stand, lean the bike
    * Seems a bit scary, but this height check lets you pedal better

## Quickly: test ride
* Take a very short ride to see if everything is good
* Try to stay nearby, so that you can come back quickly if anything goes wrong

## Last things
* Can you store your bike inside?
    * It's ok if you ride in the rain for a bit.
        * Just make sure to dry your bike when you get back inside at home.
* If you can, it's best to store your bike inside.
    * That way, your chain can stay clean and so your bike last longer.
