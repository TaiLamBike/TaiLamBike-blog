# 3: Finding old social media posts: aggregates of daddy long legs

I am not sure about the origin of this video of a cluster of daddy long legs, called by those who
study arachnids (which includes spiders, but daddy long legs are _not_ spiders), but this
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAjNLo5Ui-E) of such an aggregate being disturbed has been
known since at least 2015.<!--more-->

I first saw a clip of this on Tumblr, back when I had too much time in high school and early
undergrad.

Daddy long legs are from the order [Opiliones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opiliones).

This clip seems to be from an episode of the show
[_Outrageous Acts of Science_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outrageous_Acts_of_Science), which was
on the [Science Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Channel).

So, not lost media, but social media isn't exactly the best medium to detail sources of information.

I decided to put this here, as this deals a bit with nature and the outdoors.  There are daddy long
legs around in New England, but I don't think they gather to make aggregates, like in Mexico.
