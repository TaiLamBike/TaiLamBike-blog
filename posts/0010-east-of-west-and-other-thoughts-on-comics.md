# 10: _East of West_ and other thoughts on comics

[_East of West_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_of_West) is probably the best self-contained
story I've read recently in the general genre of comic series, graphic novel, and manga.  It's
longer than one collected book, yet isn't a series that feels like it's going on forever, such as
_Naruto_ or _Boruto_.<!--more-->

I will say that the very of _East of West_ seems to be relatively anticlimactic compared to how it
starts, yet it is still better than the ending of the original [_Matrix_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise))
film trilogy.

Regardless, _East of West_ still ends way better than [_The Empty Man_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Empty_Man),
which I felt started really well but then ended in a rather mediocre fashion -- much like the
_Matrix_ trilogy.

I sort of wished that production of the comic series [_Godslap_](https://badegg.co/collections/godslap-comics),
which was co-created by [MoistCr1TiKaL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr1TiKaL), would release more
frequently, as well as comic series of
[_Outlast: The Murkoff Account_](https://redbarrelsgames.com/comic-books/the-murkoff-account/)
and the vampire comic series [_Sucker_](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/sucker/4050-113004/).

(Though, to be fair, the continuation of the Murkoff _Outlast_ comic that I am invested in can't
finish anytime soon, as the game _Outlast III_ hasn't been released yet.)

Apparently, as of November 2023, the third and final volume of _Sucker_ is
[in production](https://www.politestrangers.com/blog/first-look-sucker-volume-3).  I really liked
this one because it had some rather sharp social commentary on
[Big Pharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry)... maybe too sharp, given that
Volume 2 was released on March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic really started in the US.

(The following links are probably NSFW-risky links, though not completely explicit, for the _Sucker_
comic: [Volume 1](https://www.politestrangers.com/shop/p/sucker-vol-1-living-after-midnight) and
[Volume 2](https://www.politestrangers.com/shop/p/sucker-v2-wasted-years) are published by Polite
Strangers.  This series was originally crowdfunded on
[Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ramonesome/sucker-a-50-page-grind-house-vampire-adventure?ref=backertracker)
and [IndieGoGo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sucker-1-2-a-horror-graphic-novel-series#/) -- I
was able to find these links despite some difficulty.)

## Conclusion

From my experiences, I think most time reading comic books and graphic novels should be done alone.
It's how I discovered all of these unique stories that almost no one in mainstream media outlets
(both in TV and film) would even consider exploring.  It's not just online ARGs,
[analog horror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_horror), and
[SCP Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundation)-esque entries that have more wildly
creative ideas than even the most unfiltered indie film and TV projects.

I think some of my formative time spent in public libraries was reading graphic novels alone.  You
learn by osmosis how to form your own opinion regarding media literacy.

I would love to see [_The Private Eye_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Private_Eye) comic adapted
into a A24-like two-part miniseries, as this finished serialization by December 2015 and is really
prescient in a post-Snowden era and the post-COVID technology chilling.  The screenplay and basic
storyboard is at least 50% towards [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) of a
screenplay script, if you think about it.

Also, adapting [_Xombi_ Volume 2](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/xombi/4050-45665/) as a stand-alone
three-part miniseries for the character [Xombi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xombi) would be my
highest personal cinematic adaptation goal.  I think DC could consider exploring some "experimental"
media entries, similar to that of the 2022 [_Werewolf by Night_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf_by_Night_(TV_special))
film special from Marvel; as much of its DC cinematic and television entries are pretty disconnected
already.

I mean, [_Spider-Man: Homecoming_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man%3A_Homecoming)
completely avoided redoing Tom Holland's being bitten by the spider and yet the film did just fine.
So, we wouldn't have to trudge through David Kim's origin story.  If your story is good, then it's
good.  A superhero-like character doesn't always have to be an origin story to have a compelling
story.

Lastly, there is some [music](https://theendmen.bandcamp.com/album/morning-birds-east-of-west-single)
(just two tracks) that was created for _East of West_, which is available on Bandcamp at a cost of
"name your price" (including free).

## Really random and funny postscript

Speaking of Bandcamp: [Nathan Barnatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Barnatt), the IRL actor
who plays the character [Dad](https://dad-feels.fandom.com/wiki/Dad), also has a [Bandcamp](https://dadfeels.bandcamp.com/music)
for all of the original music and songs created for the _Dad_ series.
