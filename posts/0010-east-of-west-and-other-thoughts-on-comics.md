# 10: _East of West_ and other thoughts on comics

[_East of West_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_of_West) is probably the best self-contained
comic series/graphic novel/manga I've come across in recent memory.  Longer than one collected book,
yet isn't a series that feels like it's going on forever, such as _Naruto_ or _Boruto_.<!--more-->

I will say that the very end seems to be rather anticlimactic, yet still better than something like
the ending of the original [_Matrix_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)) film
trilogy.

Still ends way better than [_The Empty Man_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Empty_Man), which I
felt really followed the high-level structure of the _Matrix_ trilogy; and really suffered due to
this decision.

I sort of wished that production of the [MoistCr1TiKaL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr1TiKaL), who
co-created the series [_Godslap_](https://badegg.co/collections/godslap-comics), would release more
quickly, as well as comic series of [_Outlast: The Murkoff Account_](https://redbarrelsgames.com/comic-books/the-murkoff-account/)
and the vampire comic series [_Sucker_](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/sucker/4050-113004/).
(Though, to be fair, the continuation of the _Outlast_ comic that I care about is due to the fact
that in 2024 we still don't have _Outlast III_, so that comic isn't going to be finished until the
third mainline game is released.)

Apparently, as of November 2023, the third and final volume is
[in production](https://www.politestrangers.com/blog/first-look-sucker-volume-3).  I really liked
this one because it had some rather sharp social commentary on
[Big Phara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry)... maybe too sharp, given that
Volume 2 was released on March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic really took effect.

(The following links are probably NSFW-risky links, though not completely explicit, for the _Sucker_
comic: [Volume 1](https://www.politestrangers.com/shop/p/sucker-vol-1-living-after-midnight) and
[Volume 2](https://www.politestrangers.com/shop/p/sucker-v2-wasted-years) are published by Polite
Strangers.  This series was originally crowdfunded on
[Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ramonesome/sucker-a-50-page-grind-house-vampire-adventure?ref=backertracker)
and [IndieGoGo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sucker-1-2-a-horror-graphic-novel-series#/) -- I
was able to find these links despite some difficulty.)

## Conclusion

From my experiences, I think the majority of work pertaining to reading comic books and graphic
novels is best done alone.  It's how I discovered all of these unique stories that almost no one in
mainstream media outlets (both in TV and film) would even think of exploring.  It's not just online
ARGs, [analog horror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_horror), and
[SCP Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundation)-esque entries that have more wildly
creative ideas than even the most unfiltered of indie film and TV series could ever yield.

I think some of my formative time spent in public libraries was reading graphic novels alone.  You
learn by osmosis how to form your own opinion regarding media.

I would love to see [The Private Eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Private_Eye) comic adapted
into a A24-like two-part miniseries, as this finished serialization by December 2015 and is really
prescient in a post-Snowden era and the post-COVID technology chilling.  The screenplay and basic
storyboard is at least 50% towards [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) of a
screenplay script.

I would also have achieved my cinematic dream of adapting [_Xombi_ Volume 2](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/xombi/4050-45665/)
as a stand-alone three-part miniseries for the character
[Xombi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xombi).  I think DC could consider exploring some
"experimental" media entries, the 2022
[_Werewolf by Night_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf_by_Night_(TV_special)) film special; as
much of its DC cinematic and television entries are pretty disconnected already.  I mean,
[_Spider-Man: Homecoming_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man%3A_Homecoming) completely
avoided redoing the origin story of Tom Holland's version of the character being bitten by the
spider and yet it did just fine.  So, we wouldn't have to tread through David Kim's origin story.
If your story is good, then it's good.  It doesn't need to fit the format of a very long ancient
history narrative.

Lastly, there is some [music](https://theendmen.bandcamp.com/album/morning-birds-east-of-west-single)
(just two tracks) that was created for _East of West_, which is available on Bandcamp at a cost of
"name your price" (including free).

## Really random and funny postscript

Speaking of Bandcamp: [Nathan Barnatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Barnatt), the IRL actor
who plays the character [Dad](https://dad-feels.fandom.com/wiki/Dad), also as a [Bandcamp](https://dadfeels.bandcamp.com/music)
for all of the original music and songs created for the _Dad_ series.
