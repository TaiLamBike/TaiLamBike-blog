# 11: Read Comic Online and _Kill 6 Billion Demons_

There is a site called [Read Comic Online](https://readcomiconline.li/), which I first saw when I on
a fellow student's laptop during my last year of undergraduate studies.<!--more-->

(This site is definitely violating copyright, but on the other hand there is probably no pragmatic
way I could buy physical copies of any of the _Stranger Things_ comics when I started reading those,
except probably the collected book versions.  I have yet to explore in-person comic book stores.)

In early 2024, I was browsing the site when I discovered the webcomic
[_Kill Six Billion Demons_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_Six_Billion_Demons) (_KSBD_).

Fair warning: if you thought that reading a _Boruto_ chapter monthly (or a _Naruto_ manga chapter
back during its publication run) was painful, then get this: in webcomics, the artist publish a
single **page** at a time.

Anyways, I somehow started reading volume 3 of _KSBD_ (which was the most that the website).

I was immediately hooked.  But then I went to the actual _KSBD_ [website](https://killsixbilliondemons.com/)
and realized I had no idea what I was looking at.  So, I binged everything so far.

As a note: some of the later pages aren't yet collected into book form, so that's why it seems like
Read Comic Online seems behind, but it's not.  Somehow translating _KSBD_ from the norms and customs
of webcomic doesn't always have a clear bijection to traditional print media.

I think I was shocked that the exterior and overall look of the protagonist Allison changes so
drastically, which at first confused me.  However, now I understand how this came to be.

I just wanted to talk about _KSBD_, as there is not much (meta-)explanatory material on _KSBD_ that
isn't in the comments under each page of _KSBD_ or other rather old school/obscure internet avenues
of discussing _KSBD_.
