# 11: Read Comic Online and _Kill 6 Billion Demons_

There is a site called [Read Comic Online](https://readcomiconline.li/), which I first saw when I on
a fellow student's laptop during my last year of undergraduate studies.<!--more-->

(This site is definitely violating copyright, but on the other hand there is probably no pragmatic
way I could buy physical copies of any of the _Stranger Things_ comics when I started reading those,
except in collected book versions; though I'd have to go to the library to read those.  Also, I have
yet to explore in-person comic book stores.)

In early 2024, I was browsing the site when I discovered the webcomic
[_Kill Six Billion Demons_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_Six_Billion_Demons) (or _KSBD_).

Fair warning: if you thought that reading a _Boruto_ chapter monthly (or a _Naruto_ manga chapter
back during its publication run) was painful, then the anticipation of waitng for each page of
_KSBD_ to be released might be too much for you.

Anyways, I somehow started reading the middle of the series online and quickly read through all the
books available on Read Comic Online.  As some context: it has been a while since the series has
collected the later books into print form with Image Comics, so you can get a lot further into the
story by reading the webcomic.

I was immediately hooked.  But then I went to the actual _KSBD_ [website](https://killsixbilliondemons.com/)
and realized I had no idea what was happening in the story, as the webcomic site is much further
along than the completed print books avaialbe on Read Comic Online.  So, I caught up with the story,
as of early 2024.

I was initially shocked at the outer appearance of protagonist Allison when I first opened the _KSBD_
webcomic site.  Initially, she was drawn in a way that made be believe she was a villian, which was
not the case and at first confused me.  However, after catching up with the story, I understand how
Allison came to her current state in the story.

I just wanted to talk about _KSBD_, as there is not much (meta-)explanatory material on _KSBD_
generally online, except for rather obscure places -- such as the comments under each page of _KSBD_.
