# Using cell phone tracking for traffic studies & Google's Green Light in Boston

I've sat in enough public meetings for municipal projects that involve traffic studies to know that
there aren't literally enough sensors (yet) to differentiate between walkers, bikers, and motor
vehicle drivers -- except for cell phones.

Apparently, it's very common for traffic data to be collected that depend on cell phone data, and
local municipal workers rely upon these data.

Your cell phone's location is being tracked all the time by the [SIM card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_card)-based
technology in it (or the eSIM equivalent, if you've been bamboozled by the [iPhone 14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_14)
or newer devices that exclusively use eSIM.<!--more-->

I remember an [excerpt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FRWHDzwQyw&t=109) from
_The Daily Show With Trevor Noah_ in February 2020 of how a German artist pulled 99 smartphones
(with active cellular service, and presumably signed into a Google account)
[to create a fake traffic jam](https://www.wired.com/story/99-phones-fake-google-maps-traffic-jam/)
outside the German Google headquarters.

(Noah's comedic pretext for entering this line of thought was that there are traffic jams everywhere
else away from major roadways, due to the [Waze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waze) app.
Ironically, Google also owns Waze, so it's not like you're really able to escape car traffic.)

So, when I saw, the above is what came to mind when I saw this
[video/article](https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/boston-traffic-google-green-light-artificial-intelligence/)
from CBS Boston, which mentions that Boston has the eighth worse traffic delays in the world.  This
news segment covers how Boston is 1 of 2 cities in the U.S. currently participating in the AI-based
Project Green Light program from Google to manage traffic lights at intersections (as of August 9,
2024).  (The other city at this time is Seattle, which is a bit obvious as this is the largest
international city closest to Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, WA.)

Meanwhile, all I'm thinking of is a linear combination of: [Skynet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator))
taking over the world in the _Terminator_ films; the 1995 video game adaptation
of [_I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_No_Mouth,_and_I_Must_Scream_(video_game)),
where Russia and China also had developed their own supercomputers -- and these two other countries
also posing crucial offensive cybersecurity threats to the world, current as of August 2024); and
how players can create traffic jams on the fly to stop pursuers in the _Watch Dogs_ video game
[series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_Dogs).

Though to be honest, the last _Watch Dogs_ reference is probably the idea that's probably going to
happen, at least in the short-term future.

Also, this traffic sounds a bit of [greenwashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing), as
indicated in The Hated One's videos on water depletion from [December 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo7V4PPHijs)
regarding data centers in general and in [April 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-6la_I-xkQ)
regarding AI specifically.

## Conclusion

The TV show _Mr. Robot_ was right, leave your cell phone at home (i.e., still keep it on but not on
you when doing a [surveillance detection route](https://trdcrft.com/surveillance-detection-route-sdr/)).
Your cell phone carrier doesn't care about you if it's willing to sell your cell phone location data
to mapping services, which eventually ends up in surface-level traffic studies or who knows where
else -- though to be fair, this is most likely explicitly allowed somewhere in your carrier's terms
of service and/or privacy policy when you signed up for your cell phone's SIM card.
